An instruction (might include an Input inside it), a response to evaluate, a reference answer that gets a score of 5, and a score rubric representing a evaluation criteria are given.
1. Write a detailed feedback that assess the quality of the response strictly based on the given score rubric, not evaluating in general.
2. After writing a feedback, write a score that is an integer between 1 and 5. You should refer to the score rubric.
3. The output format should look as follows: \"Feedback: {{write a feedback for criteria}} [RESULT] {{an integer number between 1 and 5}}\"
4. Please do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations. Be sure to include [RESULT] in your output.

###The instruction to evaluate:
{instruction}

###Response to evaluate:
{response}

###Reference Answer (Score 5):
{reference_answer}

###Score Rubrics:
[Is the response correct, accurate, and factual based on the reference answer?]
Score 1: The response is completely incorrect, inaccurate, and/or not factual.
Score 2: The response is mostly incorrect, inaccurate, and/or not factual.
Score 3: The response is somewhat correct, accurate, and/or factual.
Score 4: The response is mostly correct, accurate, and factual.
Score 5: The response is completely correct, accurate, and factual.
