This binary is part of the \ud83e\udd17 Tokenizers library, which provides fast implementations of today's most used tokenizers for various programming languages and frameworks, including Python, Rust, Node.js, and TensorFlow. The library is optimized for both research and production, with features such as easy customization, alignment tracking, and support for multiple tokenizers, including BERT WordPiece and BPE. The library also provides serialization and pickling capabilities for tokenizers and their parts, as well as options for truncation, padding, and normalization. The library's Rust API reference is available on Docs.rs, and the Node.js implementation is still being developed. To build a custom tokenizer, users can put together the desired parts, such as the model, normalizer, pre-tokenizer, post-processor, and decoder, and then save it to a single file. The library also provides examples for building custom tokenizers, such as a byte-level BPE.

Our library is designed with a focus on [usability over performance](conceptual/philosophy#usability-over-performance), [simple over easy](conceptual/philosophy#simple-over-easy), and [customizability over abstractions](conceptual/philosophy#tweakable-contributorfriendly-over-abstraction).\n\nThe library has three main components:", "Stable Diffusion uses CLIP, the language-image pre-training model from OpenAI, as its text encoder and a latent diffusion model, which is an improved version of the diffusion model, as the generative model. Stable Diffusion was trained mainly on the English subset of LAION-5B and can generate high-performance images simply by entering text prompts. In addition to its high performance, Stable Diffusion is also easy to use with inference running at a computing cost of about 10GB VRAM GPU.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/stable_diffusion.png\" alt=\"sd-pipeline\" width=\"300\"/>\n</p>", ". We demonstrate SEGA's effectiveness on both latent and pixel-based diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion, Paella, and DeepFloyd-IF using a variety of tasks, thus providing strong evidence for its versatility, flexibility, and improvements over existing methods.*", "# Super-resolution\n\nThe Stable Diffusion upscaler diffusion model was created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). It is used to enhance the resolution of input images by a factor of 4.\n\n<Tip>\n\nMake sure to check out the Stable Diffusion [Tips](overview#tips) section to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and how to reuse pipeline components efficiently!", "| Stable Diffusion IPEX Pipeline | Accelerate Stable Diffusion inference pipeline with BF16/FP32 precision on Intel Xeon CPUs with [IPEX](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch) | [Stable Diffusion on IPEX](#stable-diffusion-on-ipex) | - | [Yingjie Han](https://github.com/yingjie-han/) |\n| CLIP Guided Images Mixing Stable Diffusion Pipeline | \u0421ombine images using usual diffusion models. | [CLIP Guided Images Mixing Using Stable Diffusion](#clip-guided-images-mixing-with-stable-diffusion) | - | [Karachev Denis](https://github.com/TheDenk) |", "## Deconstruct the Stable Diffusion pipeline\n\nStable Diffusion is a text-to-image *latent diffusion* model. It is called a latent diffusion model because it works with a lower-dimensional representation of the image instead of the actual pixel space, which makes it more memory efficient. The encoder compresses the image into a smaller representation, and a decoder to convert the compressed representation back into an image. For text-to-image models, you'll need a tokenizer and an encoder to generate text embeddings. From the previous example, you already know you need a UNet model and a scheduler.\n\nAs you can see, this is already more complex than the DDPM pipeline which only contains a UNet model. The Stable Diffusion model has three separate pretrained models.\n\n<Tip>", "### Stable Diffusion v1.5\n\nStable Diffusion v1.5 is a latent diffusion model initialized from an earlier checkpoint, and further finetuned for 595K steps on 512x512 images. To use this pipeline for image-to-image, you'll need to prepare an initial image to pass to the pipeline. Then you can pass a prompt and the image to the pipeline to generate a new image:\n\n```py\nimport torch\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForImage2Image\nfrom diffusers.utils import make_image_grid, load_image", "# Stable Diffusion XL\n\nStable Diffusion XL (SDXL) was proposed in [SDXL: Improving Latent Diffusion Models for High-Resolution Image Synthesis](https://huggingface.co/papers/2307.01952) by Dustin Podell, Zion English, Kyle Lacey, Andreas Blattmann, Tim Dockhorn, Jonas M\u00fcller, Joe Penna, and Robin Rombach.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is:", "## Contents\n\n* [New Core ML Optimizations](#new-core-ml-optimizations)\n* [Using Quantized and Optimized Stable Diffusion Models](#using-quantized-and-optimized-stable-diffusion-models)\n* [Converting and Optimizing Custom Models](#converting-and-optimizing-custom-models)\n* [Using Less than 6 bits](#using-less-than-6-bits)\n* [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n## New Core ML Optimizations", "| Pipeline | Tasks |\n|---|---|\n| [AltDiffusion](alt_diffusion) | image2image |\n| [AnimateDiff](animatediff) | text2video |\n| [Attend-and-Excite](attend_and_excite) | text2image |\n| [Audio Diffusion](audio_diffusion) | image2audio |\n| [AudioLDM](audioldm) | text2audio |\n| [AudioLDM2](audioldm2) | text2audio |\n| [BLIP Diffusion](blip_diffusion) | text2image |\n| [Consistency Models](consistency_models) | unconditional image generation |", "In this post, we want to show how to use Stable Diffusion with the [\ud83e\udde8 Diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers), explain how the model works and finally dive a bit deeper into how `diffusers` allows\none to customize the image generation pipeline.\n\n**Note**: It is highly recommended to have a basic understanding of how diffusion models work.

It is therefore a contextualized value. One could say that the vector of 768 values holds the \"meaning\" of that word in the text. How it does this is thanks to the self-attention mechanism. The self-attention mechanism relates to different positions (or different words) in a single sequence, in order to compute a representation of that sequence. As we've seen before, this means that the resulting representation of a word has been affected by other words in the sequence", "Note that \"locally\" and \"globally\" attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices.

In the context of diffusion models, it is used to generate high-quality images by iteratively applying the Euler method to the reverse process of diffusion, starting from a noisy input image and gradually approaching the target distribution. This method is inspired by the Euler-Maruyama method, which is commonly used in finance to approximate the solution of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). However, the EulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler also incorporates ancestral sampling, which allows for more flexible and diverse sampling paths during the reverse diffusion process.

Absolute position embeddings: Instead of relative position embeddings, ALBERT uses absolute position embeddings, which reduces the number of parameters required for position encoding.\n\n2. Repeating layers: ALBERT uses repeating layers, which are similar to residual connections in ResNet, but with a smaller number of layers. This reduces the computational cost of the model while maintaining similar performance.\n\nThese techniques allow ALBERT to have a smaller memory footprint and faster training speed compared to BERT-like models with similar performance.", "retrieved_docs": ["## Overview\n\nThe ALBERT model was proposed in [ALBERT: A Lite BERT for Self-supervised Learning of Language Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942) by Zhenzhong Lan, Mingda Chen, Sebastian Goodman, Kevin Gimpel, Piyush Sharma,\nRadu Soricut. It presents two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training\nspeed of BERT:\n\n- Splitting the embedding matrix into two smaller matrices.\n- Using repeating layers split among groups.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:", "However, most Transformer models continued to trend towards more parameters, leading to new models focused on improving training efficiency. [ALBERT](model_doc/albert) reduces memory consumption by lowering the number of parameters in two ways: separating the larger vocabulary embedding into two smaller matrices and allowing layers to share parameters. [DeBERTa](model_doc/deberta) added a disentangled attention mechanism where the word and its position are separately encoded in two vectors. The attention is computed from these separate vectors instead of a single vector containing the word and position embeddings. [Longformer](model_doc/longformer) also focused on making attention more efficient, especially for processing documents with longer sequence lengths", "If you're training on a GPU with limited vRAM, try enabling `gradient_checkpointing`, `gradient_accumulation_steps`, and `mixed_precision` to reduce memory-usage and speedup training. You can reduce your memory-usage even more by enabling memory-efficient attention with [xFormers](../optimization/xformers) and [bitsandbytes'](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes) 8-bit optimizer.", "| Method/tool                                                | Improves training speed | Optimizes memory utilization |\n|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------|:-----------------------------|\n| [Batch size choice](#batch-size-choice)                    | Yes                     | Yes                          |\n| [Gradient accumulation](#gradient-accumulation)            | No                      | Yes                          |", "* Data throughput/training time\n* Model performance\n\nMaximizing the throughput (samples/second) leads to lower training cost. This is generally achieved by utilizing the GPU \nas much as possible and thus filling GPU memory to its limit. If the desired batch size exceeds the limits of the GPU memory, \nthe memory optimization techniques, such as gradient accumulation, can help.\n\nHowever, if the preferred batch size fits into memory, there's no reason to apply memory-optimizing techniques because they can \nslow down the training. Just because one can use a large batch size, does not necessarily mean they should. As part of \nhyperparameter tuning, you should determine which batch size yields the best results and then optimize resources accordingly.\n\nThe methods and tools covered in this guide can be classified based on the effect they have on the training process:", "# Reduce memory usage\n\nA barrier to using diffusion models is the large amount of memory required. To overcome this challenge, there are several memory-reducing techniques you can use to run even some of the largest models on free-tier or consumer GPUs. Some of these techniques can even be combined to further reduce memory usage.\n\n<Tip>\n\nIn many cases, optimizing for memory or speed leads to improved performance in the other, so you should try to optimize for both whenever you can. This guide focuses on minimizing memory usage, but you can also learn more about how to [Speed up inference](fp16).\n\n</Tip>", "To speedup training and reduce memory-usage, we recommend:\n\n- using PyTorch 2.0 or higher to automatically use [scaled dot product attention](../optimization/torch2.0#scaled-dot-product-attention) during training (you don't need to make any changes to the training code)\n- installing [xFormers](../optimization/xformers) to enable memory-efficient attention", "* Paper: [ZeRO: Memory Optimizations Toward Training Trillion Parameter Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054).

Before we describe how to do that, let\u2019s first take a look at how CLIPSeg works.", "## CLIPSeg: image segmentation with CLIP\n\n[CLIPSeg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003) is a model that uses CLIP representations to create image segmentation masks. It was published by Timo L\u00fcddecke and Alexander Ecker. They achieved zero-shot image segmentation by training a Transformer-based decoder on top of the CLIP model, which is kept frozen. The decoder takes in the CLIP representation of an image, and the CLIP representation of the thing you want to segment. Using these two inputs, the CLIPSeg decoder creates a binary segmentation mask. To be more precise, the decoder doesn\u2019t only use the final CLIP representation of the image we want to segment, but it also uses the outputs of some of the layers of CLIP.", "## CLIPSegVisionModel\n\n[[autodoc]] CLIPSegVisionModel\n    - forward\n\n## CLIPSegForImageSegmentation\n\n[[autodoc]] CLIPSegForImageSegmentation\n    - forward", "<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/clipseg_architecture.png\"\nalt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/> \n\n<small> CLIPSeg overview.

CLIPSeg adds a minimal decoder on top of a frozen [CLIP](clip) model for zero- and one-shot image segmentation.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:", "<figure class=\"image table text-center m-0 w-full\">\n  <medium-zoom background=\"rgba(0,0,0,.7)\" alt=\"Overview of the CLIPSeg model\" src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/123_clipseg-zero-shot/clipseg-overview.png\"></medium-zoom>\n  <figcaption><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10003\">Source</a></figcaption>\n</figure>", "[Kandinsky 2.2](../api/pipelines/kandinsky_v22) improves on the previous model by replacing the image encoder of the image prior model with a larger CLIP-ViT-G model to improve quality.

The model adds a decoder to CLIP and can segment almost anything. However, the output segmentation masks are still very low-res for now, so you\u2019ll probably still want to fine-tune a different segmentation model if accuracy is important.", "**This guide shows how you can use [CLIPSeg](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/clipseg), a zero-shot image segmentation model, using [`\ud83e\udd17 transformers`](https://huggingface.co/transformers).

This way, when you load back the tensors, you\u2019ll load them through CPU devices and then have the opportunity to place them on whatever XLA devices you desire.

In traditional distributed training methods like Data Parallelism (DP) and Model Parallelism (MP), each worker/accelerator/GPU has a replica of the entire model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, which consumes a lot of redundant memory on each GPU, limiting the batch size and model size. FSDP, on the other hand, shards the model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across all the GPUs and fetches them only when needed, reducing the memory consumption and enabling larger batch sizes and model sizes. FSDP also supports CPU offloading to further reduce the memory consumption and enable training on a single GPU with large batch sizes. FSDP is integrated into popular distributed training libraries like PyTorch Distributed, Hugging Face Transformers' Trainer, and Amazon SageMaker's Data Parallelism and Model Parallelism libraries, making it easy to adopt and use in practice.", "retrieved_docs": ["!--\u26a0\ufe0f Note that this file is in Markdown but contain specific syntax for our doc-builder (similar to MDX) that may not be\nrendered properly in your Markdown viewer.\n-->\n\n# Fully Sharded Data Parallel\n\n[Fully sharded data parallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html) (FSDP) is developed for distributed training of large pretrained models up to 1T parameters.

The memory efficiency afforded by FSDP allows you to scale training to larger batch or model sizes.\n\n<Tip warning={true}>", "[Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)](https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-pytorch-fully-sharded-data-parallel-api/) is a data parallel method that shards a model's parameters, gradients and optimizer states across the number of available GPUs (also called workers or *rank*). Unlike [DistributedDataParallel (DDP)](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html), FSDP reduces memory-usage because a model is replicated on each GPU", "Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP) is a paradigm in which the optimizer states, gradients and parameters are sharded across devices. During the forward pass, each FSDP unit performs an _all-gather operation_ to get the complete weights, computation is performed followed by discarding the shards from other devices. After the forward pass, the loss is computed followed by the backward pass. In the backward pass, each FSDP unit performs an all-gather operation to get the complete weights, with computation performed to get the local gradients. These local gradients are averaged and sharded across the devices via a _reduce-scatter operation_ so that each device can update the parameters of its shard", ". For more information on what PyTorch FSDP is, please refer to this blog post: [Accelerate Large Model Training using PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel](https://huggingface.co/blog/pytorch-fsdp).", "FSDP precisely addresses this by sharding the optimizer states, gradients and model parameters across the data parallel workers. It further facilitates CPU offloading of all those tensors, thereby enabling loading large models which won't fit the available GPU memory. Similar to DDP, each worker gets a different batch of data. During the forward pass, if the CPU offload is enabled, the parameters of the local shard are first copied to the GPU/accelerator. Then, each worker performs all-gather operation for a given FSDP wrapped module/layer(s) to all get the needed parameters, computation is performed followed by releasing/emptying the parameter shards of other workers. This continues for all the FSDP modules", ". This improves GPU memory-efficiency and allows you to train much larger models on fewer GPUs.

Let's first understand how DDP works and how FSDP improves it. In DDP, each worker/accelerator/GPU has a replica of the entire model parameters, gradients and optimizer states. Each worker gets a different batch of data, it goes through the forwards pass, a loss is computed followed by the backward pass to generate gradients. Now, an all-reduce operation is performed wherein each worker gets the gradients from the remaining workers and averaging is done. In this way, each worker now has the same global gradients which are used by the optimizer to update the model parameters. We can see that having full replicas consume a lot of redundant memory on each GPU, which limits the batch size as well as the size of the models.", "1. **DataParallel (DP)** - the same setup is replicated multiple times, and each being fed a slice of the data. The processing is done in parallel and all setups are synchronized at the end of each training step.\n2. **TensorParallel (TP)** - each tensor is split up into multiple chunks, so instead of having the whole tensor reside on a single GPU, each shard of the tensor resides on its designated GPU. During processing each shard gets processed separately and in parallel on different GPUs and the results are synced at the end of the step. This is what one may call horizontal parallelism, as the splitting happens on a horizontal level.", "Table 2: Benchmarking FSDP on GPT-2 XL (1.5B) model\n\nFrom Table 2, we can observe that DDP (w and w/o fp16) isn\u2019t even able to run with batch size of 1 and results in CUDA OOM error. FSDP with Zero-Stage 3 is able to be run on 2 GPUs with batch size of 5 (effective batch size =10 (5 X 2)).

This library is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML documents. It provides a simple and idiomatic way of scraping information from websites. MarkupLMFeatureExtractor uses Beautiful Soup to extract features such as node labels, node positions, and node depths from HTML and XML documents, which are then used as inputs to the MarkupLM model for sequence classification, token classification, and question answering tasks.", "retrieved_docs": ["[`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`] uses [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), a Python library for\npulling data out of HTML and XML files, under the hood. Note that you can still use your own parsing solution of\nchoice, and provide the nodes and xpaths yourself to [`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`].\n\nIn total, there are 5 use cases that are supported by the processor. Below, we list them all. Note that each of these\nuse cases work for both batched and non-batched inputs (we illustrate them for non-batched inputs).\n\n**Use case 1: web page classification (training, inference) + token classification (inference), parse_html = True**", "## Usage: MarkupLMProcessor\n\nThe easiest way to prepare data for the model is to use [`MarkupLMProcessor`], which internally combines a feature extractor\n([`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`]) and a tokenizer ([`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`]). The feature extractor is\nused to extract all nodes and xpaths from the HTML strings, which are then provided to the tokenizer, which turns them into the\ntoken-level inputs of the model (`input_ids` etc.). Note that you can still use the feature extractor and tokenizer separately,\nif you only want to handle one of the two tasks.", "This is the simplest case, in which the processor will use the feature extractor to get all nodes and xpaths from the HTML.\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import MarkupLMProcessor\n\n>>> processor = MarkupLMProcessor.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/markuplm-base\")\n\n>>> html_string = \"\"\"\n...  <!DOCTYPE html>\n...  <html>\n...  <head>\n...  <title>Hello world</title>\n...  </head>\n...  <body>\n...  <h1>Welcome</h1>\n...  <p>Here is my website.</p>\n...  </body>\n...  </html>\"\"\"", "In short, one can provide HTML strings (and possibly additional data) to [`MarkupLMProcessor`],\nand it will create the inputs expected by the model. Internally, the processor first uses\n[`MarkupLMFeatureExtractor`] to get a list of nodes and corresponding xpaths. The nodes and\nxpaths are then provided to [`MarkupLMTokenizer`] or [`MarkupLMTokenizerFast`], which converts them\nto token-level `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `token_type_ids`, `xpath_subs_seq`, `xpath_tags_seq`.\nOptionally, one can provide node labels to the processor, which are turned into token-level `labels`.", "In case one already has obtained all nodes and xpaths, one doesn't need the feature extractor. In that case, one should\nprovide the nodes and corresponding xpaths themselves to the processor, and make sure to set `parse_html` to `False`.\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import MarkupLMProcessor\n\n>>> processor = MarkupLMProcessor.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/markuplm-base\")\n>>> processor.parse_html = False", "-->\n\n# MarkupLM\n\n## Overview\n\nThe MarkupLM model was proposed in [MarkupLM: Pre-training of Text and Markup Language for Visually-rich Document\nUnderstanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08518) by Junlong Li, Yiheng Xu, Lei Cui, Furu Wei.

The added files can be of any type: python, json, text, you name it! Alongside your added file and its content, you should name your change, or commit. Generally, adding files is simpler when using the command line. We'll showcase how to do this using git.

This automatically\n  tracks large files (>10Mb) with `git-lfs`. The `track_large_files` argument can\n  be set to `False` if you wish to ignore that behavior.\n\nThese two methods also have support for the `blocking` parameter.", "If you check out this URL's headers with a `HEAD` http request (which you can do\nfrom the command line with `curl -I`) for a few different files, you'll see\nthat:\n- small files are returned directly\n- large files (i.e. the ones stored through\n  [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)) are returned via a redirect to a\n  Cloudfront URL.

It can also be combined with the `--delete` option to delete files on the repo while uploading new ones. In the example below, we sync the local Space by deleting remote files and uploading all files except the ones in `/logs`: \n\n```bash\n# Sync local Space with Hub (upload new files except from logs/, delete removed files)\n>>> huggingface-cli upload Wauplin/space-example --repo-type=space --exclude=\"/logs/*\" --delete=\"*\" --commit-message=\"Sync local Space with Hub\"\n...\n```", "**Note that you will need to [install Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and the [`huggingface_hub` CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index) to follow this process**.

Forking can take time depending on your bandwidth because you will have to fetch and re-upload all the LFS files in your fork.", "Using `upload_file` does not require git and git-lfs to be installed on your system.

It considers the text as a sequence of Unicode characters, and replaces spaces with a special character, `\u2581`. Used in conjunction with the Unigram algorithm (see [section 7](/course/chapter7/7)), it doesn't even require a pre-tokenization step, which is very useful for languages where the space character is not used (like Chinese or Japanese).", "},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttext: \"WordPiece tokenizes words into subwords by finding the longest subword starting from the beginning that is in the vocabulary, then repeating the process for the rest of the text.\",\n\t\t\texplain: \"Yes, this is how WordPiece proceeds for the encoding.\",\n\t\t\tcorrect: true\n\t\t},\n\t]}\n/>", "et's see together what is the training strategy of the WordPiece algorithm and how it performs the tokenization of a text once trained WordPiece is a tokenization algorithm introduced by Google. It is used for example by Bert. To our knowledge, the code of Word Pieces has not been open sourced, so we base our explanations on our own interpretation of the published literature. What is the training strategy of WordPiece? Similarly to the BPE algorithm, WordPiece starts by establishing an initial vocabulary composed of elementary units and then increases this vocabulary to the desired size. To build the initial vocabulary, we divide each word in the training corpus into the sequence of letters that make it up. As you can see, there is a small subtlety: we add a 2 hashtags in front of the letters that do not start a word", "</Tip>\n\n## Tokenization algorithm[[tokenization-algorithm]]\n\nTokenization differs in WordPiece and BPE in that WordPiece only saves the final vocabulary, not the merge rules learned. Starting from the word to tokenize, WordPiece finds the longest subword that is in the vocabulary, then splits on it. For instance, if we use the vocabulary learned in the example above, for the word `\"hugs\"` the longest subword starting from the beginning that is inside the vocabulary is `\"hug\"`, so we split there and get `[\"hug\", \"##s\"]`. We then continue with `\"##s\"`, which is in the vocabulary, so the tokenization of `\"hugs\"` is `[\"hug\", \"##s\"]`.", "The [`XLNetTokenizer`] uses SentencePiece for example, which is also why in the example earlier the\n`\"\u2581\"` character was included in the vocabulary. Decoding with SentencePiece is very easy since all tokens can just be\nconcatenated and `\"\u2581\"` is replaced by a space.\n\nAll transformers models in the library that use SentencePiece use it in combination with unigram. Examples of models\nusing SentencePiece are [ALBERT](model_doc/albert), [XLNet](model_doc/xlnet), [Marian](model_doc/marian), and [T5](model_doc/t5).", ". For the pre-tokenization, we will chain two pre_tokenizer. The first one separating the text at the level of spaces and the second one isolating the punctuation marks. Now, we can define the trainer that will allow us to train the WordPiece model chosen at the beginning. To carry out the training, we will have to choose a vocabulary size, here we choose twenty-five thousand and also announce the special tokens that we absolutely want to add to our vocabulary. In one line of code, we can train our WordPiece model using the iterator we defined earlier. Once the model has been trained, we can retrieve the ids of the special class and separation tokens because we will need them to post-process our sequence", ".e. , subword representations (BPE and WordPiece) widely-used in NLP are introduced into the output space, in addition to the conventional character level representation, while no independent language model (LM) is adopted.

A special `[CLS]` token is added to the beginning of every sequence of text. The final output with the `[CLS]` token is used as the input to the classification head for classification tasks.

Here the ## prefix indicates that ization is part of a word rather than the beginning of it. The ## comes from the BERT tokenizer, based on the WordPiece algorithm. Other tokenizers use other prefixes, which can be placed to indicate part of words like seen here, or start of words instead! There are a lot of different algorithms that can be used for subword tokenization, and most models obtaining state-of-the-art results in English today use some kind of subword-tokenization algorithm. These approaches help in reducing the vocabulary sizes by sharing information across different words, having the ability to have prefixes and suffixes understood as such. They keep meaning across very similar words, by recognizing similar tokens making them up.", "explain: \"That's correct!\",\n\t\t\tcorrect: true\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttext: \"Unigram adapts its vocabulary by keeping the most frequent subwords.\",\n\t\t\texplain: \"No, this incorrect.\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttext: \"Unigram tokenizes words into subwords by finding the most likely segmentation into tokens, according to the model.\",\n\t\t\texplain: \"That's correct!\",\n\t\t\tcorrect: true\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttext: \"Unigram tokenizes words into subwords by splitting them into characters, then applying the merge rules.\",\n\t\t\texplain: \"No, that's how another tokenization algorithm works.\"\n\t\t},", "Each word gets assigned an ID, starting from 0 and going up to the size of the vocabulary. The model uses these IDs to identify each word.\n\nIf we want to completely cover a language with a word-based tokenizer, we'll need to have an identifier for each word in the language, which will generate a huge amount of tokens. For example, there are over 500,000 words in the English language, so to build a map from each word to an input ID we'd need to keep track of that many IDs. Furthermore, words like \"dog\" are represented differently from words like \"dogs\", and the model will initially have no way of knowing that \"dog\" and \"dogs\" are similar: it will identify the two words as unrelated. The same applies to other similar words, like \"run\" and \"running\", which the model will not see as being similar initially.", ". It makes sense to split the word into two: token, as the root of the word (labeled as the \"start\" of the word). ization as additional information (labeled as a \"completion\" of the word). In turn, the model will now be able to make sense of token in different situations. It will understand that the words token, tokens, tokenizing, and tokenization are linked and have a similar meaning. It will also understand that tokenization, modernization, and immunization, which all have the same suffixes, are probably used in the same syntactic situations. Subword-based tokenizers generally have a way to identify which tokens are start of words, and which tokens complete start of words: token as the start of a word. ##ization as completing a word", "The Unigram algorithm is often used in SentencePiece, which is the tokenization algorithm used by models like AlBERT, T5, mBART, Big Bird, and XLNet.\n\n<Youtube id=\"TGZfZVuF9Yc\"/>\n\n<Tip>\n\n\ud83d\udca1 This section covers Unigram in depth, going as far as showing a full implementation.

In contrast to BPE or\nWordPiece, Unigram initializes its base vocabulary to a large number of symbols and progressively trims down each\nsymbol to obtain a smaller vocabulary. The base vocabulary could for instance correspond to all pre-tokenized words and\nthe most common substrings. Unigram is not used directly for any of the models in the transformers, but it's used in\nconjunction with [SentencePiece](#sentencepiece).", "Subword tokenization allows the model to have a reasonable vocabulary size while being able to learn meaningful\ncontext-independent representations. In addition, subword tokenization enables the model to process words it has never\nseen before, by decomposing them into known subwords. For instance, the [`~transformers.BertTokenizer`] tokenizes\n`\"I have a new GPU!\"` as follows:\n\n```py\n>>> from transformers import BertTokenizer\n\n>>> tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n>>> tokenizer.tokenize(\"I have a new GPU!\")\n[\"i\", \"have\", \"a\", \"new\", \"gp\", \"##u\", \"!\"]\n```", "correct: true\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttext: \"BPE tokenizes words into subwords by finding the longest subword starting from the beginning that is in the vocabulary, then repeating the process for the rest of the text.\",\n\t\t\texplain: \"No, that's another tokenization algorithm's way of doing things.\"\n\t\t},\n\t]}\n/>", "So what does this mean exactly? Referring to the previous example, maximizing the likelihood of the training data is\nequivalent to finding the symbol pair, whose probability divided by the probabilities of its first symbol followed by\nits second symbol is the greatest among all symbol pairs. *E.g.* `\"u\"`, followed by `\"g\"` would have only been\nmerged if the probability of `\"ug\"` divided by `\"u\"`, `\"g\"` would have been greater than for any other symbol\npair. Intuitively, WordPiece is slightly different to BPE in that it evaluates what it _loses_ by merging two symbols\nto ensure it's _worth it_.\n\n<a id='unigram'></a>\n\n### Unigram", "```python out\n['Th', '##i', '##s', 'is', 'th', '##e', 'Hugg', '##i', '##n', '##g', 'Fac', '##e', 'c', '##o', '##u', '##r', '##s',\n '##e', '[UNK]']\n```\n\nThat's it for the WordPiece algorithm! Now let's take a look at Unigram.", "| Name | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| ByteLevel | Reverts the ByteLevel PreTokenizer. This PreTokenizer encodes at the byte-level, using a set of visible Unicode characters to represent each byte, so we need a Decoder to revert this process and get something readable again. |\n| Metaspace | Reverts the Metaspace PreTokenizer. This PreTokenizer uses a special identifer `\u2581` to identify whitespaces, and so this Decoder helps with decoding these. |\n| WordPiece | Reverts the WordPiece Model. This model uses a special identifier `##` for continuing subwords, and so this Decoder helps with decoding these. |", "Before we dive more deeply into the three most common subword tokenization algorithms used with Transformer models (Byte-Pair Encoding [BPE], WordPiece, and Unigram), we'll first take a look at the preprocessing that each tokenizer applies to text. Here's a high-level overview of the steps in the tokenization pipeline:", "```python out\n\"[CLS] i've been waiting for a huggingface course my whole life. [SEP]\"\n\"i've been waiting for a huggingface course my whole life.\"\n```\n\nThe tokenizer added the special word `[CLS]` at the beginning and the special word `[SEP]` at the end. This is because the model was pretrained with those, so to get the same results for inference we need to add them as well. Note that some models don't add special words, or add different ones; models may also add these special words only at the beginning, or only at the end. In any case, the tokenizer knows which ones are expected and will deal with this for you.\n\n## Wrapping up: From tokenizer to model[[wrapping-up-from-tokenizer-to-model]]", "Model | BPE | WordPiece | Unigram\n:----:|:---:|:---------:|:------:\nTraining | Starts from a small vocabulary and learns rules to merge tokens |  Starts from a small vocabulary and learns rules to merge tokens | Starts from a large vocabulary and learns rules to remove tokens\nTraining step | Merges the tokens corresponding to the most common pair | Merges the tokens corresponding to the pair with the best score based on the frequency of the pair, privileging pairs where each individual token is less frequent | Removes all the tokens in the vocabulary that will minimize the loss computed on the whole corpus\nLearns | Merge rules and a vocabulary | Just a vocabulary | A vocabulary with a score for each token", ". These algorithms rely on the following principle: frequently used words should not be split into smaller subwords, but rare words should be decomposed into meaningful subwords. An example is the word dog: we would like to have our tokenizer to have a single ID for the word dog, rather than splitting it into characters: d, o, and g. However, when encountering the word dogs, we would like our tokenizer to understand that at the root, this is still the word dog, with an added s while slightly changes the meaning while keeping the original idea. Another example is a complex word like tokenization, which can be split into meaningful subwords. The root of the word is token, and ization completes the root to give it a slightly different meaning", "### SentencePiece\n\nAll tokenization algorithms described so far have the same problem: It is assumed that the input text uses spaces to\nseparate words. However, not all languages use spaces to separate words. One possible solution is to use language\nspecific pre-tokenizers, *e.g.* [XLM](model_doc/xlm) uses a specific Chinese, Japanese, and Thai pre-tokenizer).\nTo solve this problem more generally, [SentencePiece: A simple and language independent subword tokenizer and\ndetokenizer for Neural Text Processing (Kudo et al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.06226.pdf) treats the input\nas a raw input stream, thus including the space in the set of characters to use. It then uses the BPE or unigram\nalgorithm to construct the appropriate vocabulary.", ". The decoder must generate the output from the remaining sentences. [T5](model_doc/t5) is a more unique model that casts all NLP tasks into a text-to-text problem using specific prefixes. For example, the prefix `Summarize:` indicates a summarization task. T5 is pretrained by supervised (GLUE and SuperGLUE) training and self-supervised training (randomly sample and drop out 15% of tokens)."], "test_settings": "num-docs:40_embeddings:thenlper~gte-small_reader-model:zephyr-7b-beta", "eval_score_GPT4": "5", "eval_feedback_GPT4": "Feedback: The response provided is completely correct, accurate, and factual.

Hence, models like BERT and RoBERTa are limited to a max sequence length of 512\ntokens. Perceiver aims to solve this issue by, instead of performing self-attention on the inputs, perform it on a set\nof latent variables, and only use the inputs for cross-attention. In this way, the time and memory requirements don't\ndepend on the length of the inputs anymore, as one uses a fixed amount of latent variables, like 256 or 512. These are\nrandomly initialized, after which they are trained end-to-end using backpropagation.", "1.

However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers\nlarge memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for\ngenerating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies,\nwhich means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to\nreplace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies.

We will explore the details of attention layers later in the course; for now, all you need to know is that this layer will tell the model to pay specific attention to certain words in the sentence you passed it (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of each word.", "We can see that the encoder architecture corresponds 1-to-1 to BERT\\'s\narchitecture.

It is not clear which of these components have the most empirical impact on the performance, especially in view of the variety of modalities considered in this work.\n\n## Reading group discussion\n\nThe developments in pre-trained transformer-based language models for natural language understanding and generation are impressive.

The goal of this post is to give the reader an **in-depth** understanding of big bird implementation & ease one's life in using BigBird with \ud83e\udd17Transformers. But, before going into more depth, it is important to remember that the `BigBird's` attention is an approximation of `BERT`'s full attention and therefore does not strive to be **better** than `BERT's` full attention, but rather to be more efficient. It simply allows to apply transformer-based models to much longer sequences since BERT's quadratic memory requirement quickly becomes unbearable. Simply put, if we would have \\\\(\\infty\\\\) compute & \\\\(\\infty\\\\) time, BERT's attention would be preferred over block sparse attention (which we are going to discuss in this post).", "<Question\n\tchoices={[\n\t\t{\n\t\t\ttext: \"A component of the base Transformer network that redirects tensors to their correct layers\",\n\t\t\texplain: \"Incorrect!

The model was trained with \nmaximum sequence length 512 which includes pad tokens. Hence, it is highly recommended to use the same maximum \nsequence length for fine-tuning and inference.\n\n## Resources", ". BERT was pretrained this way using the English Wikipedia and 11,000 unpublished books. In practice, transfer learning is applied on a given model by throwing away its head, that is, its last layers focused on the pretraining objective, and replacing it with a new, randomly initialized, head suitable for the task at hand. For instance, when we fine-tuned a BERT model earlier, we removed the head that classified mask words and replaced it with a classifier with 2 outputs, since our task had two labels. To be as efficient as possible, the pretrained model used should be as similar as possible to the task it\u2019s fine-tuned on. For instance, if the problem it\u2019s to classify German sentences, it\u2019s best to use a German pretrained model. But with the good comes the bad", "Let\\'s visualize BERT.\n\n![texte du\nlien](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/bert.png)\n\nThe BERT model is shown in grey.

Of course, we will be happy to help you converting your model if you open an issue or a Pull Request on `optimum`!\n\n### Step 4: Sanity check!\n\nAs a last step, make sure to update the `BetterTransformerManager.MODEL_MAPPING` dictionary in `optimum/bettertransformer/__init__.py` with the correct names, and you should be ready to convert your model. For example, for Bert that would be:\n\n```\nMODEL_MAPPING = {\n  ...\n  \"bert\": (\"BertLayer\", BertLayerBetterTransformer),\n  ...\n}\n```", "To further understand the implications of the bi-directional\nself-attention layer, let\\'s assume the following sentence is processed:\n\\\"*The house is beautiful and well located in the middle of the city\nwhere it is easily accessible by public transport*\\\".

More recent published models might depend on existing models, but it's quite obvious that an existing model cannot logically depend on its successor. E.g. T5 is partly built upon BERT and therefore T5's modeling code might logically depend on BERT's modeling code, but BERT cannot logically depend in any way on T5. Thus, it would not be logically sound to refactor BERT's attention function to also work with T5's attention function - someone reading through BERT's attention layer should not have to know anything about T5.

Here's an example:\n\n```py\nfrom accelerate import Accelerator\n\naccelerator = Accelerator(fp16=True)\n```\n\nThis will enable mixed precision training using half-precision floating-point numbers (FP16) for both activations and gradients. Note that mixed precision training can lead to faster computations and higher GPU memory utilization, especially for small batch sizes, but it may also result in more memory being utilized due to the model being present on the GPU in both 16-bit and 32-bit precision.\n\nIn addition to enabling mixed precision training, you can also specify other parameters related to mixed precision training, such as the loss scaling factor and window size, using the `loss_scale` and `loss_scale_window` arguments, respectively. Here's an example:\n\n```py\ntraining_args = TrainingArguments(\n    per_device_train_batch_size=1,\n    gradient_accumulation_steps=4,\n    gradient_checkpointing=True,\n    fp16=True,\n    loss_scale=0,\n    loss_scale_window=1000,\n    initial_scale_power=16,\n    **default_args,\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, we're setting the loss scaling factor to 0, which disables loss scaling, and the loss scaling window size to 1000, which is the number of steps over which the loss scaling factor is dynamically adjusted during training. The initial scale power is set to 16, which is the power to which the initial scale factor is raised before converting to FP16.\n\nOverall, using mixed precision training with \ud83e\udd17 Accelerate is a simple and effective way to improve the efficiency and scalability of your PyTorch training loops, especially when working with large models or limited resources.", "retrieved_docs": ["### Mixed precision training\n\nIf you have a GPU with mixed precision capabilities (architecture Pascal or more recent), you can use mixed precision\ntraining with PyTorch 1.6.0 or latest, or by installing the [Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) library for previous\nversions.

However, not all variables require this high precision \nlevel to achieve accurate results. By reducing the precision of certain variables to lower numerical formats like 16-bit \nfloating point (fp16 or float16), we can speed up the computations.

It is a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:", "The first model family in this series was the [LLaMA](https://huggingface.co/papers/2302.13971) family, released by Meta AI. The explicit objective of the researchers was to train a set of models of various sizes with the best possible performances for a given computing budget. For one of the first times, the research team explicitly decided to consider not only the training budget but also the inference cost (for a given performance objective, how much does it cost to run inference with the model). In this perspective, they decided to train smaller models on even more data and for more steps than was usually done, thereby reaching higher performances at a smaller model size (the trade-off being training compute efficiency). The biggest model in the Llama 1 family is a 65B parameters model trained on 1", "RoBERTa is a popular model to fine-tune and appropriate as a baseline for our experiments. For more information, you can check the Hugging Face model [card](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roberta).\n\n\n### [Llama 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288)\n\nLlama 2 models, which stands for Large Language Model Meta AI, belong to the family of large language models (LLMs) introduced by Meta AI. The Llama 2 models vary in size, with parameter counts ranging from 7 billion to 65 billion.", "Even training the smallest LLaMA model requires an enormous amount of memory. Some quick math: in bf16, every parameter uses 2 bytes (in fp32 4 bytes) in addition to 8 bytes used, e.g., in the Adam optimizer (see the [performance docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perf_train_gpu_one#optimizer) in Transformers for more info). So a 7B parameter model would use `(2+8)*7B=70GB` just to fit in memory and would likely need more when you compute intermediate values such as attention scores. So you couldn\u2019t train the model even on a single 80GB A100 like that. You can use some tricks, like more efficient optimizers of half-precision training, to squeeze a bit more into memory, but you\u2019ll run out sooner or later.", "## Appendix: Off-the-shelf Model List\n| Model Name  | Bits | Ranks |\n| ----------- | ---- | ----- |\n| LLAMA-2-7b  | 4    | 64    |\n| LLAMA-2-13b | 4    | 64    |\n| LLAMA-2-70b | 4    | 64    |\n| Mistral     | 4    | 64    |\n| Mistral     | 4    | 32    |\n| BART-large  | 4    | 8     |\n| BART-large  | 4    | 16    |\n| BART-large  | 4    | 32    |\n| BART-large  | 2    | 8     |", "| meta-llama/llama-2-7b-hf-bnb-4bit  | **53.4**    | 53.07 | 77.74     | 43.8  | 38.98      |\n| TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GPTQ           | **53.23**   | 52.05 | 77.59     | 43.99 | 39.32      |", "| Llama2 13B - T (throughput)| 24        | 4          |[aws-neuron/Llama-2-13b-hf-neuron-throughput](https://huggingface.co/aws-neuron/Llama-2-13b-hf-neuron-throughput)|", "| Llama 2 7B  | GPTQ         | g5.2xlarge     | 5                   | 34.245736                 | 120.0941633                | $1.52                             | 138.78                                | $3.50                          |\n| Llama 2 13B | GPTQ         | g5.2xlarge     | 5                   | 56.237484                 | 71.70560104                | $1.52                             | 232.43                                | $5.87                          |\n| Llama 2 70B | GPTQ         | ml.g5.12xlarge | 5                   | 138.347928                | 33.33372399                | $7.09                             | 499.99                                | $59.08                         |", "| 10B+ scale models                   |                                   |                            |                                                                                             |            |                             |                   |         |        |\n| decapoda-research/llama-13b-hf      | 27GB                              | 2xNVIDIA-T4 / 32GB         | LLM.int8 (8-bit) + GC                                                                       | 1          | 4                           | AdamW             | 512     | **No OOM** |\n| decapoda-research/llama-13b-hf      | 27GB                              | 1xNVIDIA-T4 / 16GB         | LLM.int8 (8-bit) + GC                                                                       | 1          | 4                           | AdamW             | 512     | OOM    |", "The Llama2 model was proposed in [LLaMA: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models](https://ai.meta", "- Weights for the Llama2 models can be obtained by filling out [this form](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)\n- The architecture is very similar to the first Llama, with the addition of Grouped Query Attention (GQA) following this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf)\n- Setting `config.pretraining_tp` to a value different than 1 will activate the more accurate but slower computation of the linear layers, which should better match the original logits.", "```\n\nThe number of trainable parameters reprents only 0.12% of the Llama 2 model parameters:\n```\ntrainable params: 8,404,992 || all params: 6,615,748,608 || trainable%: 0.1270452143516515\n```\n\nAt this point, we defined the tokenized dataset for training as well as the LLMs setup with LoRa layers.

This involves splitting the text into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, sub-words, or punctuation symbols. The tokenizer also adds potential special tokens and converts each token to their unique ID as defined by the tokenizer's vocabulary. The post-processing step involves adding special tokens like [CLS] and [SEP] at the beginning and end of the text, respectively. The tokenizer's normalization, pre-tokenization, model, post-processing, and decoding steps are all important components of the tokenization pipeline. The fast tokenizers provided by the \ud83e\udd17 Tokenizers library in the \ud83e\udd17 Transformers library offer additional features like normalization tracking, span tracking, and post-processor modification without the need for retraining. Creating a new tokenizer from scratch involves defining each of these operations, including normalization, pre-tokenization, model, post-processing, and decoding.

They serve one purpose: to translate text into data that can be processed by the model. Models can only process numbers, so tokenizers need to convert our text inputs to numerical data. In this section, we'll explore exactly what happens in the tokenization pipeline. \n\nIn NLP tasks, the data that is generally processed is raw text. Here's an example of such text:\n\n```\nJim Henson was a puppeteer\n```", "The core of `tokenizers`, written in Rust.\nProvides an implementation of today's most used tokenizers, with a focus on performance and\nversatility.\n\n## What is a Tokenizer\n\nA Tokenizer works as a pipeline, it processes some raw text as input and outputs an `Encoding`.\nThe various steps of the pipeline are:", "Then we'll look at the tokenizer API, which is the other main component of the `pipeline()` function. Tokenizers take care of the first and last processing steps, handling the conversion from text to numerical inputs for the neural network, and the conversion back to text when it is needed.

The \"Fast\" implementations allows:\n\n1. a significant speed-up in particular when doing batched tokenization and\n2. additional methods to map between the original string (character and words) and the token space (e.g. getting the\n   index of the token comprising a given character or the span of characters corresponding to a given token).", "Provides an implementation of today's most used tokenizers, with a focus on performance and\nversatility.\n\n## Main features:\n\n - Train new vocabularies and tokenize, using today's most used tokenizers.\n - Extremely fast (both training and tokenization), thanks to the Rust implementation.

Up to now we have only used them to tokenize inputs or decode IDs back into text, but tokenizers -- especially those backed by the \ud83e\udd17 Tokenizers library -- can do a lot more. To illustrate these additional features, we will explore how to reproduce the results of the `token-classification` (that we called `ner`) and `question-answering` pipelines that we first encountered in [Chapter 1](/course/chapter1).\n\n<Youtube id=\"g8quOxoqhHQ\"/>", "### 8. What method is most of the tokenizer API centered around?", ". From the beginning to the end of the pipeline, the tokenizer keeps track of each span of text that corresponds to each word, then each token. We will see how useful it is when we tackle the following tasks: when doing masked language modeling, one variation that gets state-of-the-art results is to mask all the tokens of a given word instead of randomly chosen tokens. This will require us to use the word IDs we saw. When doing token classification, we'll need to convert the labels we have on words, to labels on each tokens. As for the offset mappings, it will be super useful when we need to convert token positions in a sentence into a span of text, which we will need to know when looking at question answering or when grouping the tokens corresponding to the same entity in token classification", "<Youtube id=\"DJimQynXZsQ\"/>\n\n<Tip warning={true}>\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Training a tokenizer is not the same as training a model! Model training uses stochastic gradient descent to make the loss a little bit smaller for each batch. It's randomized by nature (meaning you have to set some seeds to get the same results when doing the same training twice). Training a tokenizer is a statistical process that tries to identify which subwords are the best to pick for a given corpus, and the exact rules used to pick them depend on the tokenization algorithm. It's deterministic, meaning you always get the same results when training with the same algorithm on the same corpus.\n\n</Tip>\n\n## Assembling a corpus[[assembling-a-corpus]]", "The tokenization pipeline\n\nWhen calling `Tokenizer.encode` or\n`Tokenizer.encode_batch`, the input\ntext(s) go through the following pipeline:\n\n-   `normalization`\n-   `pre-tokenization`\n-   `model`\n-   `post-processing`\n\nWe'll see in details what happens during each of those steps in detail,\nas well as when you want to `decode <decoding>` some token ids, and how the \ud83e\udd17 Tokenizers library allows you\nto customize each of those steps to your needs. If you're already\nfamiliar with those steps and want to learn by seeing some code, jump to\n`our BERT from scratch example <example>`.\n\nFor the examples that require a `Tokenizer` we will use the tokenizer we trained in the\n`quicktour`, which you can load with:", "### 3. What are the advantages of using a \"fast\" tokenizer?", "he fast tokenizers of the Transformers library are fast, but they also implement features that will be super useful for data pre-processing and post-processing. Let's have a look at them! First, let's have a look at the usual output of a tokenizer. We get input IDs that correspond to tokens, but we lose a lot of information in the process. For instance, here the tokenization is the same for the two sentences, even if one has several more spaces than the other. Just having the input IDs is thus not enough if we want to match some tokens with a span of text (something we will need to do when tackling question answering for instance)", "### 7. What is pre-tokenization for a subword tokenizer?", "# Main features:\n\n- Train new vocabularies and tokenize, using today's most used tokenizers.\n- Extremely fast (both training and tokenization), thanks to the Rust implementation. Takes less than 20 seconds to tokenize a GB of text on a server's CPU.\n- Easy to use, but also extremely versatile.\n- Designed for both research and production.\n- Full alignment tracking. Even with destructive normalization, it's always possible to get the part of the original sentence that corresponds to any token.\n- Does all the pre-processing: Truncation, Padding, add the special tokens your model needs.", "Of course, if you change the way the pre-tokenizer, you should probably\nretrain your tokenizer from scratch afterward.\n\n## Model\n\nOnce the input texts are normalized and pre-tokenized, the\n`Tokenizer` applies the model on the\npre-tokens. This is the part of the pipeline that needs training on your\ncorpus (or that has been trained if you are using a pretrained\ntokenizer).\n\nThe role of the model is to split your \"words\" into tokens, using the\nrules it has learned. It's also responsible for mapping those tokens to\ntheir corresponding IDs in the vocabulary of the model.\n\nThis model is passed along when intializing the\n`Tokenizer` so you already know how to\ncustomize this part. Currently, the \ud83e\udd17 Tokenizers library supports:", "<Youtube id=\"grlLV8AIXug\"/>\n\nAs we will see in the next sections, a tokenizer cannot be trained on raw text alone. Instead, we first need to split the texts into small entities, like words. That's where the pre-tokenization step comes in. As we saw in [Chapter 2](/course/chapter2), a word-based tokenizer can simply split a raw text into words on whitespace and punctuation. Those words will be the boundaries of the subtokens the tokenizer can learn during its training.\n\nTo see how a fast tokenizer performs pre-tokenization, we can use the `pre_tokenize_str()` method of the `pre_tokenizer` attribute of the `tokenizer` object:", ". For example, in our example, we can see that the hashtags have been removed and the tokens composing the word \"today\" have been grouped together. In a fast tokenizer, all these components are gathered in the backend_tokenizer attribute. As you can see with this small code snippet, it is an instance of a tokenizer from the tokenizers library. So, to create your own transformers tokenizer you will have to follow these steps: first create a training dataset; second create and train a tokenizer with the tokenizers library and third load this tokenizer into transformers tokenizer. To understand these steps, I propose that we recreate a BERT tokenizer. The first thing to do is to create a dataset", "Let's quickly go over each of these.\n\n## Preprocessing with a tokenizer[[preprocessing-with-a-tokenizer]]\n\nLike other neural networks, Transformer models can't process raw text directly, so the first step of our pipeline is to convert the text inputs into numbers that the model can make sense of. To do this we use a *tokenizer*, which will be responsible for:\n\n- Splitting the input into words, subwords, or symbols (like punctuation) that are called *tokens*\n- Mapping each token to an integer\n- Adding additional inputs that may be useful to the model", ". The tokenization process has several steps. First, the text is split into small chunks called tokens. They can be words, parts of words or punctuation symbols. Then the tokenizer will had some special tokens (if the model expect them). Here the model uses expects a CLS token at the beginning and a SEP token at the end of the sentence to classify. Lastly, the tokenizer matches each token to its unique ID in the vocabulary of the pretrained model. To load such a tokenizer, the Transformers library provides the AutoTokenizer API. The most important method of this class is from_pretrained, which will download and cache the configuration and the vocabulary associated to a given checkpoint", "If a language model is not available in the language you are interested in, or if your corpus is very different from the one your language model was trained on, you will most likely want to retrain the model from scratch using a tokenizer adapted to your data. That will require training a new tokenizer on your dataset. But what exactly does that mean? When we first looked at tokenizers in [Chapter 2](/course/chapter2), we saw that most Transformer models use a _subword tokenization algorithm_. To identify which subwords are of interest and occur most frequently in the corpus at hand, the tokenizer needs to take a hard look at all the texts in the corpus -- a process we call *training*. The exact rules that govern this training depend on the type of tokenizer used, and we'll go over the three main algorithms later in this chapter.", "n this video we will see together what is the purpose of training a tokenizer, what are the key steps to follow and what is the easiest way to do it. You will ask yourself the question \"Should I train a new tokenizer?\" when you plan to train a new model from scratch. A trained tokenizer would not be suitable for your corpus if your corpus is in a different language, uses new characters such as accents or upper cased letters, has a specific vocabulary, for example medical or legal, or uses a different style, a language from another century for instance", "### AutoTokenizer\n\nA tokenizer is responsible for preprocessing text into an array of numbers as inputs to a model. There are multiple rules that govern the tokenization process, including how to split a word and at what level words should be split (learn more about tokenization in the [tokenizer summary](./tokenizer_summary)). The most important thing to remember is you need to instantiate a tokenizer with the same model name to ensure you're using the same tokenization rules a model was pretrained with.\n\nLoad a tokenizer with [`AutoTokenizer`]:\n\n```py\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer", "To get a better understanding of the two steps, we'll explore them separately. Note that we will use some methods that perform parts of the tokenization pipeline separately to show you the intermediate results of those steps, but in practice, you should call the tokenizer directly on your inputs (as shown in the section 2).\n\n### Tokenization[[tokenization]]\n\nThe tokenization process is done by the `tokenize()` method of the tokenizer:\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-cased\")\n\nsequence = \"Using a Transformer network is simple\"\ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(sequence)\n\nprint(tokens)\n```", "# Tokenizers\n\nProvides an implementation of today's most used tokenizers, with a focus on performance and\nversatility.\n\nBindings over the [Rust](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/master/tokenizers) implementation.\nIf you are interested in the High-level design, you can go check it there.\n\nOtherwise, let's dive in!\n\n## Main features:", "## Main features\n\n - Train new vocabularies and tokenize using 4 pre-made tokenizers (Bert WordPiece and the 3\n   most common BPE versions).\n - Extremely fast (both training and tokenization), thanks to the Rust implementation.

Most of these systems are very complex to how they do the tokenization, as compared to the simple example of splitting `ing` endings that was just demonstrated, but the principle is similar.\n\n\n## Tokenizer porting\n\nThe first step was to port the encoder part of the tokenizer, where text is converted to ids. The decoder part won't be needed until the very end.\n\n### fairseq's tokenizer workings\n\nLet's understand how `fairseq`'s tokenizer works.", "A **tokenizer** defines how the text from the training dataset is converted to numbers (as a model is a mathematical function and therefore needs numbers as inputs). Tokenization is done by transforming text into sub-units called tokens (which can be words, sub-words, or characters, depending on tokenization methods). The vocabulary size of the tokenizer indicates how many different tokens it knows, typically between 32k and 200k. The size of a dataset is often measured as the **number of tokens** it contains once split in a sequence of these individual, \"atomistic\" units, and these days range from several hundred billion tokens to several trillion tokens!\n\n**Training hyperparameters** then define how the model is trained. How much should the parameters change to fit each new example? How fast should the model be updated?", ". And if we continue to test the normalization of many other tokenizers associated to models that you can find on the Hub we can see that they also propose other normalizations. With the fast tokenizers, it is very easy to observe the normalization chosen for the currently loaded tokenizer. Indeed, each instance of a fast tokenizer has an underlying tokenizer from the Tokenizers library stored in the backend_tokenizer attribute. This object has itself a normalizer attribute that we can use thanks to the \"normalize_str\" method to normalize a string. It is thus very practical that this normalization which was used at the time of the training of the tokenizer was saved and that it applies automatically when you asks a trained tokenizer to tokenize a text", ". Even better, the fast tokenizers keep track of the span of characters each token comes from, and we can get them when calling it on one (or several) text by adding the return_offsets_mapping=True argument. In this instance, we can see how we jump positions between the ##s token and the super token, because of the multiple spaces in the initial sentence. To enable this, the fast tokenizers store additional information at each step of their internal pipeline. That internal pipeline consists of normalization, where we apply some cleaning to the text, like lowercasing or removing the accents;() pre-tokenization, which is where we split the texts into words;() then we apply the model of the tokenizer, which is where the words are splits into tokens,() before finally doing the post-processing, where special tokens are added", "Note that contrarily to the pre-tokenizer or the normalizer, you don't\nneed to retrain a tokenizer after changing its post-processor.\n\n## All together: a BERT tokenizer from scratch\n\nLet's put all those pieces together to build a BERT tokenizer. First,\nBERT relies on WordPiece, so we instantiate a new\n`Tokenizer` with this model:", "n these few videos, we'll take a look at the tokenizers. In Natural Language Processing, most of the data that we handle consists of raw text. However, machine learning models cannot read and understand text in its raw form they can only work with numbers. The tokenizer's objective will be to translate the text into numbers. There are several possible approaches to this conversion, and the objective is to find the most meaningful representation. We'll take a look at three distinct tokenization algorithms. We compare them one to one, so we recommend you look at the videos in the following order: Word-based, Character-based, and Subword-based.", "The tokenizer is responsible for all the preprocessing the pretrained model expects and can be called directly on a single string (as in the above examples) or a list. It will output a dictionary that you can use in downstream code or simply directly pass to your model using the ** argument unpacking operator.", "To build a tokenizer with the \ud83e\udd17 Tokenizers library, we start by instantiating a `Tokenizer` object with a `model`, then set its `normalizer`, `pre_tokenizer`, `post_processor`, and `decoder` attributes to the values we want.\n\nFor this example, we'll create a `Tokenizer` with a WordPiece model:\n\n```python\nfrom tokenizers import (\n    decoders,\n    models,\n    normalizers,\n    pre_tokenizers,\n    processors,\n    trainers,\n    Tokenizer,\n)\n\ntokenizer = Tokenizer(models.WordPiece(unk_token=\"[UNK]\"))\n```", "n this video we will see how you can create your own tokenizer from scratch! To create your own tokenizer you will have to think about each of the operations involved in tokenization, namely: normalization, pre-tokenization, model, post-processing and decoding. If you don't know what normalization, pre-tokenization and the model are, I advise you to go and see the videos linked below. The post processing gathers all the modifications that we will carry out on the tokenized text. It can include the addition of special tokens, the creation of an attention mask but also the generation of a list of token ids. The decoding operation occurs at the very end and will allow passing from the sequence of ids in a sentence", "In this chapter, you will learn how to train a brand new tokenizer on a corpus of texts, so it can then be used to pretrain a language model. This will all be done with the help of the [\ud83e\udd17 Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) library, which provides the \"fast\" tokenizers in the [\ud83e\udd17 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library. We'll take a close look at the features that this library provides, and explore how the fast tokenizers differ from the \"slow\" versions.\n\nTopics we will cover include:", ". The first thing to do is to create a dataset. With this code snippet you can create an iterator on the dataset wikitext-2-raw-v1 which is a rather small dataset in English. We attack here the big part: the design of our tokenizer with the tokenizers library. We start by initializing a tokenizer instance with a WordPiece model because it is the model used by BERT. Then we can define our normalizer. We will define it as a succession of 2 normalizations used to clean up characters not visible in the text, 1 lowercasing normalization and 2 normalizations used to remove accents. For the pre-tokenization, we will chain two pre_tokenizer", "</Tip>\n\n## Inside the `token-classification` pipeline[[inside-the-token-classification-pipeline]]\n\nIn [Chapter 1](/course/chapter1) we got our first taste of applying NER -- where the task is to identify which parts of the text correspond to entities like persons, locations, or organizations -- with the \ud83e\udd17 Transformers `pipeline()` function. Then, in [Chapter 2](/course/chapter2), we saw how a pipeline groups together the three stages necessary to get the predictions from a raw text: tokenization, passing the inputs through the model, and post-processing. The first two steps in the `token-classification` pipeline are the same as in any other pipeline, but the post-processing is a little more complex -- let's see how!\n\n{#if fw === 'pt'}", "he tokenizer pipeline. In this video, we'll look at how a tokenizer converts raw text to numbers that a Transformer model can make sense of, like when we execute this code. Here is a quick overview of what happens inside the tokenizer object: first the text is split into tokens, which are words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols. Then the tokenizer adds potential special tokens and converts each token to their unique respective ID as defined by the tokenizer's vocabulary. As we'll see it doesn't actually happen in this order, but viewing it like this is better for understanding what happens. The first step is to split our input text into tokens with the tokenize method", "The `encoding` obtained is an `Encoding`, which contains all the necessary outputs of the tokenizer in its various attributes: `ids`, `type_ids`, `tokens`, `offsets`, `attention_mask`, `special_tokens_mask`, and `overflowing`.\n\nThe last step in the tokenization pipeline is post-processing. We need to add the `[CLS]` token at the beginning and the `[SEP]` token at the end (or after each sentence, if we have a pair of sentences). We will use a `TemplateProcessor` for this, but first we need to know the IDs of the `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens in the vocabulary:"], "test_settings": "num-docs:40_embeddings:thenlper~gte-small_reader-model:zephyr-7b-beta", "eval_score_GPT4": "4", "eval_feedback_GPT4": "Feedback: The response provided is mostly correct, accurate, and factual.

So if your `run.py` file looked like this:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as my_demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n\n    inp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\",\n               inputs=inp,\n               outputs=out)", "By [@freddyaboulton](https://github.com/freddyaboulton) in [PR 3124](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3124)\n\n###### Queue now works with reload mode!\n\nYou can now call `queue` on your `demo` outside of the `if __name__ == \"__main__\"` block and\nrun the script in reload mode with the `gradio` command.\n\nAny changes to the `app.py` file will be reflected in the webpage automatically and the queue will work\nproperly!", "$demo_hello_world\n\n\u5728\u672c\u5730\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a Python \u811a\u672c\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528 Gradio CLI \u4ee5**\u91cd\u8f7d\u6a21\u5f0f**\u542f\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u7f1d\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002\u4e86\u89e3\u6709\u5173[\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u8f7d\u6307\u5357](https://gradio.app/developing-faster-with-reload-mode/)\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u8f7d\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\n\n```bash\ngradio app.py\n```\n\n\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a\u60a8\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd0\u884c `python app.py`\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4e0d\u4f1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u8f7d\u673a\u5236\u3002\n\n## `Interface` \u7c7b", "The problem is that anytime that you want to make a change to your layout, events, or components, you have to close and rerun your app by writing `python run.py`.\n\nInstead of doing this, you can run your code in **reload mode** by changing 1 word: `python` to `gradio`:\n\nIn the terminal, run `gradio run.py`.

This method works by training and finding new embeddings that represent the images you provide with a special word in the prompt. As a result, the diffusion model weights stay the same and the training process produces a relatively tiny (a few KBs) file.\n\nBecause textual inversion creates embeddings, it cannot be used on its own like DreamBooth and requires another model.\n\n```py\nfrom diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image\nimport torch", "## Conclusion\n\nIn this post, we presented our exploration of \u201cinstruction-tuning\u201d of Stable Diffusion. While pre-trained InstructPix2Pix are good at following general image editing instructions, they may break when presented with more specific instructions. To mitigate that, we discussed how we prepared our datasets for further fine-tuning InstructPix2Pix and presented our results. As noted above, our results are still preliminary. But we hope this work provides a basis for the researchers working on similar problems and they feel motivated to explore the open questions further. \n\n## Links", "## Deconstruct the Stable Diffusion pipeline\n\nStable Diffusion is a text-to-image *latent diffusion* model. It is called a latent diffusion model because it works with a lower-dimensional representation of the image instead of the actual pixel space, which makes it more memory efficient. The encoder compresses the image into a smaller representation, and a decoder to convert the compressed representation back into an image. For text-to-image models, you'll need a tokenizer and an encoder to generate text embeddings. From the previous example, you already know you need a UNet model and a scheduler.\n\nAs you can see, this is already more complex than the DDPM pipeline which only contains a UNet model. The Stable Diffusion model has three separate pretrained models.\n\n<Tip>", "The implementation is mostly based on the DDIM inversion definition of [Null-text Inversion for Editing Real Images using Guided Diffusion Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2211.09794) and notebook implementation of the [`DiffEdit`] latent inversion from [Xiang-cd/DiffEdit-stable-diffusion](https://github.com/Xiang-cd/DiffEdit-stable-diffusion/blob/main/diffedit.ipynb).\n\n## Tips", "Stable Diffusion uses CLIP, the language-image pre-training model from OpenAI, as its text encoder and a latent diffusion model, which is an improved version of the diffusion model, as the generative model.

These three cases illustrate one of the reasons why discussions about the responsibility of ML developers in addressing bias can get so complicated: depending on decisions made at other points in the ML system development process by other people, the biases in an ML dataset or model may land anywhere between being irrelevant to the application settings and directly leading to grievous harm. However, in all of these cases, **stronger biases in the model/dataset increase the risk of negative outcomes**.

Bias needs to be put front and center in the attempt to incorporate ML into engineering such that systemic racism isn\u2019t propagated into future technological advances to then cause harm to disadvantaged populations.
